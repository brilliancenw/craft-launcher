# This Free Plugin Will Change How You Use Craft CMS Forever

**Bold claim? Maybe. But once you try it, you'll never go back.**

Let's be honest: You're spending too much time clicking through menus. Every single day, you're navigating to the same entries, the same settings pages, the same configuration screens. You know exactly where you're going, but you still have to click, click, click your way there.

What if there was a better way? What if you could access anything in your Craft installation with a single keyboard shortcut?

That's not a hypothetical question. That's [Craft Launcher](https://plugins.craftcms.com/launcher), and it's about to change everything.

## Featured at Dot All 2025 Lisbon

Before we dive in, a quick shout-out: Craft Launcher was featured at [Dot All 2025 in Lisbon](https://craftcms.com/events/dot-all-2025), Craft CMS's international conference. Huge thanks to the Pixel & Tonic team for the recognition and for building the incredible platform that makes plugins like this possible.

Now, let's talk about why this changes everything.

## One Keyboard Shortcut. Your Entire Site.

Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K` on Windows/Linux). That's it. From anywhere in your admin panel, you now have instant access to:

- Every entry, category, asset, and global set
- All users and Commerce data (customers, orders, products)
- Every plugin setting and configuration page
- All sections, entry types, and field definitions
- Every system setting from email config to routes

No menus. No clicking. No "where was that setting again?"

If you've used Spotlight on macOS or Command Palette in VS Code, you already know how powerful this is. If you haven't, prepare to wonder how you ever worked without it.

## It Learns What You Actually Use

Here's where it gets transformative: Craft Launcher doesn't just search. It learns.

Every time you navigate to a page (not just search for it, but actually go there), the plugin tracks it. Over time, it builds a personalized dashboard of your most-used content. Open the launcher without typing anything, and there they are: your popular items, ranked by how often you actually use them.

**The homepage you edit 10 times a day?** First result.

**That plugin setting you check constantly?** Right there.

**The Commerce order page you live in?** Waiting for you.

You stop searching and start launching. That's the difference.

## The Frontend Changes Everything

This is the feature that makes people say "wait, what?"

Enable the front-end launcher in your account preferences. Now go to your live website. View any entry. Press `Cmd+K`. Search for "edit."

You're now editing that specific entry. From the front-end. With one keyboard shortcut.

No logging into the admin panel. No hunting through section menus. No "okay, what section was this in again?"

Content editors love this. Developers love this. Anyone who has ever needed to quickly fix a typo on a live page loves this.

## Browse Mode: Your Site Map, Actually Useful

Type `*` and hit enter. Welcome to Browse Mode.

Now you can systematically explore your entire Craft installation:
- Every entry across all sections
- Your complete user directory
- All plugins and their settings
- Every system configuration page
- Asset volumes and category groups

It's like having a comprehensive site map that actually helps you work faster instead of just sitting in documentation no one reads.

## Your Plugins Work Together Now

Here's where version 1.1 takes things to the next level. Craft Launcher includes an integration framework that turns it into a unified command center for your entire Craft ecosystem.

**Running [Blitz](https://plugins.craftcms.com/blitz?craft5)?** Cache status appears next to every entry. Clear individual page caches with one click.

**Using [View Count](https://plugins.craftcms.com/view-count?craft5)?** View stats show up right in your search results. No separate dashboards.

**Plugin developer?** The integration API is open. Add your own status displays, metrics, or actions.

Instead of switching between different plugins and dashboards, everything you need is in one place.

## Real Workflows, Real Impact

**For Content Editors:**
- Access your most-edited entries instantly
- Edit from the front-end without admin panel navigation
- See cache status and clear pages without asking developers
- Track content performance alongside your workflow

**For Developers:**
- Jump to any setting, field, or plugin config in seconds
- Check cache status while debugging
- Integrate your own plugins into the command center
- Stop context-switching between admin sections

**For Commerce Managers:**
- Search orders by reference number instantly
- Find customers by email without drilling through menus
- Access product pages directly
- See everything you need in one search

**For Site Administrators:**
- Navigate to any system setting immediately
- Manage users without menu navigation
- Check cache and performance data inline
- Maintain complete control with zero extra clicks

## Keyboard Shortcuts That Make Sense

- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` - Open launcher (and close it)
- `Return` - Go to first result
- `Cmd+1-9` - Jump to specific results
- `*` - Enter browse mode
- Arrow keys - Navigate
- `Esc` - Close

Everything is configurable. Prefer Alt instead of Cmd? Change it. Want different navigation shortcuts? Adjust them. The plugin adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

## Security You Can Trust

The front-end launcher isn't just convenient - it's secure:

- Only works when you're logged in with proper permissions
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (30 searches per minute)
- Automatic bot detection keeps crawlers out
- Permission validation on every action
- CSRF protection built-in

You get power and convenience without compromising security.

## Why It's Free

We built Craft Launcher to solve our own workflow problems at [Brilliance](https://www.brilliancenw.com/). We were tired of clicking through menus dozens of times a day. We wanted Spotlight for Craft CMS.

So we built it. And we made it free because we believe productivity tools should be accessible to everyone in the Craft community.

## The Change Is Permanent

Once you start using Craft Launcher, going back feels impossible. That's not marketing hyperbole - it's what users tell us.

You'll catch yourself pressing `Cmd+K` in other applications. You'll wonder why every CMS doesn't work this way. You'll forget what it was like to click through menus because you won't do it anymore.

That's what we mean when we say it changes how you use Craft CMS forever.

**Stop clicking. Start launching.**

Install [Craft Launcher](https://plugins.craftcms.com/launcher) today and see what you've been missing.
