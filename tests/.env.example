# Test Configuration (Optional)
# Copy this to your project's main .env file if you need to override defaults

# PHP Binary Path (auto-detected if not set)
# The test scripts will automatically find PHP in MAMP or system PATH
# Only set this if you need a specific PHP version
# PHP_BIN=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php8.2.26/bin/php

# Project Root (auto-detected if not set)
# The test scripts automatically find the Craft project root
# Only set this if auto-detection fails
# PROJECT_ROOT=/Users/yourname/Sites/your-project

# Test Timeout (in seconds)
# Maximum time to wait for tests to complete
# TEST_TIMEOUT=60

# Verbose Output
# Set to 1 to see detailed configuration information
# TEST_VERBOSE=0

# ====================================================================
# Note: These variables are OPTIONAL
# ====================================================================
# The test scripts use smart auto-detection and will work without
# any configuration in most cases. Only add these to your .env if:
#
# 1. Auto-detection fails (rare)
# 2. You want to use a specific PHP version
# 3. You need custom timeout values
# 4. You want verbose debugging output
#
# The auto-detection will find:
# - Craft project root (by looking for vendor/craftcms)
# - PHP binary (checks MAMP, then system PATH)
# - Plugin root (relative to test directory)
